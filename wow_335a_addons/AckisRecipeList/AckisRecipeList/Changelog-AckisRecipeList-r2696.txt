Moved creation of arlSpellTooltip from addon:InitializeFrame() into the main file body, and changed its parent from MainPanel to UIParent.
In SetSpellTooltip(): Copy GameTooltip's main settings over to arlSpellTooltip so AddOns which modify GameTooltip will work on it.
Moved the setting of arlSpellTooltip's scale from addon:DisplayFrame() to SetSpellTooltip(), where the config option will actually work.
Moved the setting of arlTooltip's scale to after its anchor points have been cleared then set so the config option will actually work.
Moved TipTac skinning of arlSpellTooltip from addon:InitializeFrame() to SetSpellTooltip().
In giveDisplay(): Change L["UI Scale"] to _G.UI_SCALE, removed check for addon.Frame's existence, and removed the attempt to set the scale of arlTooltip and arlSpellTooltip.
Removed "UI Scale" from the localization table.
Removed some comments for which their code was obvious in function.
Removed global references to arlTooltip and arlSpellTooltip.
Added file-local arlTooltip, as there is no reason for it to be global.

Removed addon:ToggleFrame() - its code is now the OnClick handler for the scan button, since that was its primary function - toggling the visibility of the frame was only a side-effect. Also, no longer set the player's profession here, since that is done in addon:Scan().
Changed the OnClick handler for ARL_ArmorButton to toggle armor filters iteratively rather than individually.
Changed the OnClick handler for ARL_WeaponButton to toggle weapon filters iteratively rather than individually.
Renamed addon:GenericMakeCB() to Generic_MakeCheckButton().

SetProgressBar() is now MainPanel:UpdateProgressBar()
Renamed MainPanel:ResetTitle() to MainPanel:UpdateTitle()
Re-worked ARL_ClassButton's OnClick script to iteratively toggle class filters rather than doing them individually, and replaced a call to UnitClass("player") with Player["Class"].

When generating a new entry for the ScrollFrame list, set its is_header member to true if it actually is a header, otherwise ignore it - nil > false
Changed DEBUG() to addon:DEBUG().

ARL_RecipeScrollFrame is now MainPanel.scroll_frame, and is created at the top of the file instead of in addon:InitializeFrame()

Removed WipeDisplayStrings() and initDisplayStrings() - their code now resides in MainPanel.scroll_frame:Update().
addon.RecipeItem_OnClick() is now RecipeItem_OnClick(), is defined within a do block in addon:InitializeFrame(), and now utilizes a "self" parameter so it no longer needs to be set as a script from a closure.
RepFilterSwitch() is now a local function within a do block in addon:InitializeFrame().
ARL_ProgressBarText now uses :SetFormattedText() rather than :SetText() to help reduce garbage generation.
Removed the check for the old "Skill" sort type - certainly, nobody is still running a version of ARL that has it.
Renamed most of the DisplayString members.

Removed SaveFramePosition() - its code now resides in MainPanel's OnMouseUp script.
Moved faction_strings and CheckDisplayFaction() into a do block with expandEntry(), since they are both only used there.
CheckDisplayFactions() now has one parameter, down from two.
Removed file-local variable currentProfIndex - we now use MainPanel.profession
Moved SortedProfessions and NUM_PROFESSIONS to the Constants section in the file.

The "addon" table now has seven new sub-tables: custom_list, mob_list, quest_list, reputation_list, trainer_list, seasonal_list, and vendor_list - this was done in an effort to be rid of the practice of passing tables to other files via function parameters.
New file: Player.lua - contains functions which were ripped from other files and re-worked or re-written to support the notion that the player is its own entity.
addon:DisplayFrame() now only has one parameter, down from nine, due to no longer passing tables between files in that manner.
Replaced all occurrences of "playerData" with "Player", and all of its subtables named "playerWhatever" are now simply "Whatever".
Removed addon:SetRepDB() - it was never used anywhere and was only a wrapper function anyway.
Tidied up CheckDisplayFaction() a bit.
Removed some "local globals" and replaced them with per-use definitions where applicable.
SetProgressBar() no longer has a parameter.
In addon:DisplayFrame(): Removed a call to WipeDisplayStrings(), since initDisplayStrings() calls it itself.
In AckisRecipeList.lua: Renamed NUM_FLAGS to NUM_FILTER_FLAGS.

Renamed InitializeRecipes() to InitializeRecipe() since that is exactly what it does, and re-worked its code. It also no longer resides within a do block.
Changed addon:AddRecipeData() to no longer check for the existence of RecipeList (it will always exist) and simply return InitializeRecipe() - so now it is merely a wrapper function (wondering if there is actually a reason it should exist)
In addon:GetExclusions(): Re-worked to minimize table lookups and removed the RecipeDB parameter since it always uses RecipeList.

In addon:UpdateFilters(): Re-write for improved efficiency/readability, removed all parameters as unnecessary.

In addon:CheckDisplayRecipe(): Moved the profession check to the top of the function so we can bail out immediately, and replaced 34 "if" checks for filter flags with an iteratitive check over the new HardFilterMap table. Also, did some cleaning of the syntax.
In CheckReputationDisplay(): Minor cleanup.

The following functions no longer exist, since they were only used in addon:Scan() and their code now resides there: addon:ScanForKnownRecipes(), ResetKnown(), and GetTradeSpecialty().
Assigned spellIDs as the values in the specialty tables instead of "true". This allows the removal of GetSpellLink() and other sortid code when assigning the specialty during a scan.
Removed various checks for the existence of addon.Frame, since it will always exist now.

Moved creation of MainPanel out of InitializeFrame() and into the main file body.
Removed "playerFaction" and "exclude" parameters from GenerateTooltipContent(), since that information is available from the file scope. Updated both places where it is used.
ARL_SwitcherButton is now MainPanel.mode_button.
SetSwitcherTexture() has been re-written and is now mode_button:ChangeTexture().

Moved all of the database-related tables into file scope.
Moved creation of the scan button from addon:OnEnable() to addon:OnInitialize().
All player initialization is done from within addon:OnEnable() instead of addon:Scan(), and no longer has its own function.
GetKnownProfessions() no longer exists - its code is done directly within the player initialization.
