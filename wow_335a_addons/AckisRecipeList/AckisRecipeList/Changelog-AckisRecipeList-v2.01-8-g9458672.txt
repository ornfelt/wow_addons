James D. Callahan III:
	- Removed the Mob Drop filter flag from Warbear Harness - this is a World Drop item.
	- Removed the Mob Drop filter flag from ten Alchemy recipes - the Instance filter flag should be the only relevant one, because the Mob Drop flag is intended for unique-mob drops in the world.
	- Removed the Instance filter flag from "Enchant Shield - Lesser Block"; this is a World Drop recipe.
mike:
