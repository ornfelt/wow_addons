	- - Re-added  /dcr disable and /dcr enable commands

	- - Fix for Chamans: 'Cleans Spirit' was not replacing 'Cure Toxins', the two spells were both active and confusing for the user.
	- When Decursive reconfigures itself (due to talent swap for exemple) it triiggers a refresh of the options UI.
	- - Added the current version of Decursive to the 'General' option tab.
	- - Changed the message added to debug stack "Locals:" section when debuglocals() returns nothing to a better one. The message will not appear for current PTR or futur WoW versions (they fixed it apparently)
	- Fix typo in whatsnew.txt
	- - Fix: Macro key binding was reset on relog
	- - Updated WhatsNew.txt and QuoiDeNeuf.txt for 2.4.5 beta 1 release.
	- - Fix filter removal confirmation
	- Fix to some option width
	- - fix option table indenting and creation (it will be created only when Decursive is loaded and not when the source file is loaded)
	- - Fix some GLOBAL calls
	- - This is the fIrst Ace3 version available for early testing, everything should work. The new option UI should be tested.
	- Options reorganization, added an explanation in the cure options tab (new locals require translation)
	- Some code/comment cleaning
	- - Fix events handling
	- Re-added an option to enable/disable debugging output
	- - Fixed global space accidental pollution (thanks to "luac -p -l")
	- - Fix a big mistake concerning profile options management (other Ace3 add-ons were enable to manage their profile)
	- Fix indenting (indentation is only made of spaces now)
	- The Macro key binding is now a global setting (no longer bind to the profile)
	- - MUF options are now using tabs, this fixes the cosmetic issues in the Blizz option UI
	- - Multiple fixes to option display, options are fully exported to Blizz UI options, a big cosmetic issue remains with MUF options though
	- - Various fixes in options UIs, Blizz option UI is almost done (most options panel are missing)
	- - AceDBOptions-3.0 added
	- - Fix Options handling
	- Fix messages display
	- Added security to generated reports if a spell stop existing to prevent a DDOS on my mailbox.
	- - Finishing conversion to Ace3, still a lot to do about the options, it's quite a mess...
	- - Removed links to libstub registered libraries (things like Dcr.LQT = LibStub('LibQTip-1.0'); to see if it relates to http://www.wowace.com/addons/decursive/tickets/30-decursive-2-4-3-2-13-g2d06434-freeze-wow-at-loading/#c2 (I have a feeling...)
	- - Removed LICENSE.txt since it's generated by the packager
	- - Replaced TabbletLib by LibQtip-1.0
	- - Changed license to "All Rights Reserved" see LICENSE.txt
	- - Decursive no longer uses AceOO internaly
	- - Fixed a leftover related to previous attempt of using LibOOP, this fixes a Lua error when mouseovering the LiveList items.
	- - Added WoW build info to auto generated debug report
	- - Removed LibOOP since it's causing compatibility issues and also because we don't really need it (Decursive only uses basic inheritance at this point...).
	- - When Decursive installation is broken (missing file or missing library) it will generate less errors (XML <OnLoad> get disabled)
	- Fix file load order check that was no longer accurate.
	- - Decursive will not display its "hotfix message" in the chat if Lua error reporting is disabled.
	- - made a little change to .pkgmeta in hope that the CurseClient will see that it needs to install LibOOP if using the -nolib version :/
	- made so Decursive's auto diagnostic checks for LibOOP existance
	- removed some useless TOC lines
	- - Removed LibStub from the .pkgmeta since it's embeded as a hard copy.
	- Added LibStub in X-Embeds in the TOC (why wasn't it there already?)
	(The hardcopy was introduced when Blizzard broke optional deps loading order at some point in the past)
	- - First step converting to Ace3: replacing "AceOO" by "LibOOP", this is done for the LiveList objects only for now.
	- - Removed the 'Ignore stealthed units' option that is useless since several years.
	- Added an option (localization needed) to just show stealth status instead and fix its update.
	- Removed a comment containing lyrics from a NIN song (Closer from TDS) I was listening while coding a while ago... (it could have been misunderstood)
