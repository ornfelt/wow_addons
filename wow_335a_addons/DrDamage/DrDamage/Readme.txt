*** If any damage/healing calculation is incorrect, please report it. Provide as much information as possible. ***

DrDamage displays the calculated, average damage or healing of abilities with talents, gear and buffs included on your actionbar buttons. 
The addon will also add various information to the default tooltips in your spellbook and on the actionbar.


**Slash Commands:**

/drdmg or /drdamage


**Functionality:**

* Supports all classes
* Actionbar addons supported: Default, Bartender 4, Dominos, Macaroon, Nurfed AB, FlexBar2, IPopBar, nUI, RDX and CT_BarMod.
* Places text with the metric of your choosing on the actionbar buttons
* Damage and healing statistics are placed into your tooltips. This includes for example critical hit chance, spell damage and damage coefficients, averages, DPS, DPSC (damage per seconds cast), damage until OOM and more!
* Your own buffs and your target's debuffs are taken into account
* Allows manual modification of the essential base stats used to calculate. For example you can test how much +100 spellpower would increase your damage or healing output.


**FAQ:**

*Are you planning to make a user interface for configuration?
** DrDamage has a FuBar plugin capability for easy configuration. DeuceCommander works as well.
*Can I donate?
**If you wish. PayPal: gagorian (at) gmail.com


**Donations:**

I've received questions about if it's possible to donate. Donations are appreciated and the money goes to paying for wotlk and then my account as I've quit the game.
	

**Current status (as of 1.6.6):**

All classes are considered up to date. Nearly all relevant glyphs and set bonuses have been added (note: old world set bonuses will not be supported). Certain buffs and debuffs may still be missing.

* **NOTE: DETAILED reports about inaccuracies is the only way we'll know something is wrong. If you don't report it, don't expect it to get fixed!**


**Known issues:**

* Certain damage spells/abilities display no damage information, because they have complicated calculations. These few might be implemented eventually.


**Bug reports:**

*Please report any other issues you come across, preferably by submitting a ticket:
**http://www.wowace.com/projects/dr-damage/
**Put your cursor over the tickets menu at the top and select "Post a ticket" (You need to have a wowace account and login first)


**Bug reports should include**:

*Any **error messages**.
*Which **actionbar addon** you use. 
*Your **class** and **level**.
*If the issue is an **accuracy issue**, please try to include **detailed** damage/heal numbers of what DrDamage claims and what you're actually seeing.
** It's **very helpful** to know your **talent build**. A link to your talent build, or to your **armory profile**.

Please note that bug reports that simply include the error, can be difficult to interpret, making it very hard to locate the actual issue. Remember, the more information you give, the easier it is for me to find the issue and resolve it!
