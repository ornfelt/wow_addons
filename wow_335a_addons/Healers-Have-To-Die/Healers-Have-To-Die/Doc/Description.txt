Healers Have To Die (for World of Warcraft)
===========================================


*Now you can spot those nasty healers instantly and help them to accomplish their destiny!*


This is a very simple and light add-on. It just rings when you hover or target
a unit of the opposite faction who healed someone else during the last 60
seconds (*can be configured*).

This add-on uses the Ace3 framework.
