- fixed a few edge cases where custom cooldown bars would not display when the spell was ready and the bar was set to "when ready" mode. this could happen if the player ran out of mana then gained enough back to cast the spell or for ranged spells where the target moved in and out of range

- added a "second highest threat" overlay to the Threat module that shows where the next-closest person is on the threat bar (in terms of their raw threat value divided by yours) iff you're the current tank. this is untested in a raid environment, though it should work. also, the second bar doesn't animate. i don't really think it needs to, but it could be made to if desired
