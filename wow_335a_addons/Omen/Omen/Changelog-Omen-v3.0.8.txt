Tag release v3.0.8


--------------------

Xinhuan:
	- Minor ConfigMode behavior change.
	- Omen will now update its bars immediately on showing from a hidden state instead of updating on the next threat event.
	- Update version to 3.0.8, Interface number to 30200, and repackage all the new translations contributed by users. Add libdatabroker-1-1 to tools-used in pkgmeta file.
	- GC away some one-use initialization functions after they are run.
	- Add ConfigMode support (see addon OneButtonConfig).
	- Remove the LoadAddOn workaround for loading disembedded libraries which was broken before patch 3.1.
	- Fix GetShapeShiftFormInfo() error that occurs for DKs when they aren't in any presence. This occurs when they respec between their primary/secondary specs and the game drops them out of all presences and subsequently enter combat presence-less.
