Tagging as v4.0.0-beta9


--------------------

Shefki:
	- Allow groups that were previously deleted during the current session to
	be recreated without requiring a reload/logout before they'll work.
	- Fix Ticket 643: Latency bar disappears if attempting to cast while
	already casting.
	
	UNIT_SPELLCAST_FAILED_QUIET shouldn't be watched for the CastBarLatency
	module.  It's only fired for situations that aren't interesting to the
	CastBarLatency module.
	- Tooltip option should disable and show as being set to Never if
	click-through is set on the frame since click-through won't allow
	us to detect the mouse is in the frame.
	- Fix some slopy implementation in the Unit and Caster Aura filter types.
	In particular known and unknown make no sense in the context of the Unit
	filter type and known and unknown should take no unit parmeter.
	- Always set the minimum width and height on the group header.  Prevents
	the positioning of group frames from being wrong after resizing the
	frames.
	- Aura filter update to support 3.3.3.
	- Revert "Make the Aggro module function when run in an unpackaged format."
	This reverts commit 5a648e4b0fa5b9a8270a6fa107d0dc3186a99bed.
	
	This was drycoded based on a report from ckknight.  It's not necessary
	and was causing errors.  Fixes ticket 708.
	- Split the Highlight filters for dispellable debuffs and extra friend
	debuffs.  The combination of these into one filter caused you to always
	to color the highlight by debuff type or a custom color.
	- Allow the Aura filters used for Highlights access to the consolidate and
	spell id filter types for frames that aren't showing auras but do have
	a highlight configured.
	- Ticket 707: Show buffs and debuffs cast by your vehicle in the default
	aura filters.
	- Ticket 504: Allow the Strata to be configurable.
	Adds Strata and Frame level options to the layout editor under General.
	- SetHorizTile and SetVertTile calls replace the use of
	SetTexCoordModifiesRect.
	- Fix Ticket 686: Addons registering media with SharedMedia that are
	loaded after PitBull4 and/or it's modules would not be used until the
	next normal update was triggered.  This commit forces an update when
	relevent media is registered to the relevent elements so that they will
	use the proper media regardless of load order.
	- New fix for Ticket 326 that's less hackish.  Does more work on startup
	but has no presistent overhead.
	- Revert "Fix ticket 326 et al: Border on player/pet frame doesn't show on login"
	This reverts commit a4434cd2a8a77cb2bb8dbfb44563332e20583c28.
	
	Changing to handle this in a different way.
	- Fix some improper behavior with CastBar backgrounds and add an option to
	show the background when nothing is being cast to satisfy ticket 705.
	- Fix Ticket #704: PTR error due to removed function.  Without extra stuff
	this time.
	- Revert "Fix Ticket #704: PTR error due to removed function."
	This reverts commit a577e558bff77a801c6f988d5a959c44e9333e3d.
	
	Due to accidentally commiting a lot of other unrelated stuff.
	- Fix Ticket #704: PTR error due to removed function.
vangual:
	- Also consider GCD in Latency.
	- Added optional queue display to Latency module. Please test and let me know if the default values work for you aswell. (Based on data from EJ)
Shefki:
	- Fix error that occurs in some rare cases while loading.
	- Hmm so I guess somehow a text can exist without the events table.
	- Fix an error in LuaTexts default Health texts.  The wrong event was
	used.  This fix includes code that walks the saved variables and fixes
	the event problem, essentailly renaming UNIT_HEALTHMAX to the proper
	UNIT_MAXHEALTH.
Cameron Knight:
	- Add per-unit font size multipliers, allowing you to (for instance), make your pet unit half the height and then decrease the font size appropriately so it all fits.
	- Fix what appears to be a typo
Shefki:
	- Allow pet groups to optionally not leave gaps for missing pets.
	- Remove some code duplicated by putting a deep_copy in Utils.
	- Make GetState() return the current state accounting for forced_state.
	- Code to support the state to be set manually.  No UI provided yet.
	Though it can be don with something like:
	PitBull4.StateHeader:SetAttribute("forced_state","raid25")
	or
	PitBull4.StateHeader:SetAttribute("forced_state",nil)
	
	First one would force PB4 to believe it's always in raid25 mode and the
	later would put it back into the existing automatic behavior.
	- Stop the Portrait from flashing on state changes since the background
	wasn't being hidden.
	- CombatText needs an OnHide method so the text won't flash during state
	changes after being in config mode.
	- Annother assertion to help me track down issue 475.
	- Fix an assertion error caused by the power colors used in the Airship and Saurfang
	encounters.  Blizzard's own numbers were out of bounds.
	- Ticket 684: Aura filter based on combat.
	Based on patch by enyim.
	Note: Using this filter forces polling of auras.  It may not be
	desireable for large numbers of frames.
	- Ticket 682: Warlock self buffs filter update.
	Based on patch from Niightblade.
vangual:
	- Ticket #611: Add VisualHeal option to clamp overheals.
Shefki:
	- Add support for some non-standard power types having their own color
	configuration as used in Ulduar and Icecrown Citadel.
	- Ticket #360: Tooltip Toggle.
	- Ticket 671: Remove aura id doesn't work.
	- Fix a typo in the description on the New id control in the Spell id
	filter.
	- Ticket 672: Aura filter controls missing order parameter, end up sorted
	by the localized name.
	- Ticket 666: Visual heal fails to anchor properly with defecit bars.
	- Ticket 673: Profiles broken because ckknight fails to test his code.
	In particular you can't LoadAddOn in the main chunk because that forces
	OnInitialize to end up being called before the SVs are ready.  So use an
	OptDeps, LoadAddOn in OnInitialize and put the LibStub in ADDON_LOADED
	where it belongs.
	- Ticket #667: Deleted groups show up again in subsequent config mode
	entries until the next reload.  They should be disabled before being
	hidden.
	- Add Should consolidate and spell id filter types to the Aura filter
	system.
	- Use AnyUp for the Clicks we capture since it's what we really want
	rather than listing all of the possible values.
Cameron Knight:
	- try to Load the addon LibBossIDs-1.0 if it isn't loaded already. Note: not going to add LibBossIDs-1.0 as a proper dependency or put it in PB4 embedded, as it's mostly just nice fluff and we don't want to bloat up PB4.
	- Add support for LibBossIDs-1.0 for classification checks, so that non-worldbosses will show up as bosses based on their MobID.
Shefki:
	- Make the Aggro module function when run in an unpackaged format.
	- Ticket 645: OH temporary weapon enchants bug out due to a typo.
	- Ticket 644: Full Body Portraits not always proper zoom.
	- Fix typo in the TOC that messes up the addon list title for role icon.
