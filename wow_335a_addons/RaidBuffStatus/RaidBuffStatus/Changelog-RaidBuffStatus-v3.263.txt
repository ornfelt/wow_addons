RaidBuffStatus:
- Added an option so that rather than whispering just one Priest to buff fortitude, it will whisper them all.
- Added a feature which lets you right click on Drums of the Forgotten Kings, Runescroll of Fortitude and Drums of the Wild when it is missing and it will cast for you instead of having to find them in your bags.
