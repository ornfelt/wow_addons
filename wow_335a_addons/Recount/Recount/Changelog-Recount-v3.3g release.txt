- GetInstanceInfo() is robust at PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD hence deletion code should now be hack-free.

- Fix for problem that PEW does have an updated IsInInstance() but GetRealZoneText() can be not updated. This broke the new instance only check. The fix is a fairly ugly hack because it bypasses a problem that really is on Blizz's side.

- Second pass on cross-realm pet handling. Worked when tested and should no longer have pathological fail cases. Cross-realm pets will now show as PetName <OwnerName-OwnerRealm>.

- Added disambiguation of the two Scourge Strike components. The shadow part will now be reported as Scourge Strike (Shadow). I would prefer a more generic solution but always adding the spell school is too spammy for my taste, so this will have to do for now.
