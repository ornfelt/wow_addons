Fixed typo (Self:Print vs self:Print)
Changed checkbox for disable addon to enable addon (better handling of Ace3's Enable() and Disable() )
Moved waitingForAccept[target] = {} assign to ResComm_Ressed (previously, if you cancelled a cast, it still thought target was ressed, and wouldn't try to res target)
If you do not have a res spell, the keybindings will be visable but non-interactable in the options screen
Changed/Added/Deleted some localization strings

Push new version to use latest alpha of LibResComm-1.0, which has cross-realm awareness of targets and ressers. Needs LOTS of testing please and thank you!
No changes other than that since previous build of SmartRes2
