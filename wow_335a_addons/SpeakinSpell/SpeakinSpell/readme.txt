WHERE TO FIND MORE DOCUMENTATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

wowace.com and curse.com both host project pages for SpeakinSpell, which both contain significantly more documentation, answers to support questions asked by other users of SpeakinSpell, how-to discussions, discussions of planned feature ideas, known bugs, and more.  Search either of those sites for "SpeakinSpell" to find more information.  The SpeakinSpell project pages on both sites also link to each other.

changelog.txt in this folder lists the changes in each new version of SS at a more understandable high level than the source code revision history documentation (the SVN log) shown on the change log at curse.com's SpeakinSpell download page.

SDD.doc in this folder is the Software Design Document, a MS Word '97-2003 format document describing the design and architecture for programmers interested in developing/enhancing/debugging the addon source code.

2. Activate any abilities, trigger any procced effects, and encounter any other detectable events that you would like SpeakinSpell to announce. 

3. Type "/SpeakinSpell" ("/ss" also works) to access the interface options panel 

4. Click on "Create New..." or type "/ss create" to create settings for a new spell or other event 

5. Select the desired spell or event from the list and click the Create button. You will be taken to the settings page for that spell or event.
