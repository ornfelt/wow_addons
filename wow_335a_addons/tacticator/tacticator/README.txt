An addon for storing and sening tactics and other messages
to the party, raid, battleground, channel # or say channels.
The stored information is shared between all your characters
and is stored between sessions.

Usage:

/tacticator - Opens the Tacticator
/tacticator hide - Hides the Tacticator
/tacticator history - Shows the incoming message history
(You can also set a key shortcut in the usual way)

Creating a tactic:
Enter a name of a tactic in the top left edit box.
Press add.
Select the tactic in the dropdown.
Enter a text in the big text box in the center.
Press save if you want to store it.
Select the right channel.
Press send.

Once a tactic is slected in the dropdown it can be deleted
or renamed by the user.
If you want to rename it just enter a new name in the top left
edit box and press rename.

Incoming messages:
If another user of tacticator sends a message to the raid/party/battleground
that you are in the message will pop up in the history frame.
The incoming tactics will be sorted in the order they came and can be copied
to your own list of tactics by pressing save. If no name is entered into the
small textbox when you copy the tactic the default name in the
dropdown will be used.
